+ Using javascript map/filter/reduce, write code to provide information about the data.
+ You must provide at least 3 different measures, but you may do more.
    + Some things you might consider
        + % gender of the whole population.
        + median age
        + number of minors
        + ...
+ Have an html page that displays the information (don't forget to provide an explanation for what you are showing.
+ Note: 
    + Just copy the data into your js code as a string and run JSON.parse on it. This is not an exercise in reading in data from a file.
